# 42 C++ tests/evaluation

IN PROGRESS

This is my dedicated testing site for the 42 C++ projects.

If you are evaluating somebody you can use this as an addon. __Make sure to also test what's inside the evaluation sheet!__

[Also see the general tests for all projects.](https://github.com/poechlauerbe/42_tests)

## general stuff

1. There are also memory leaks in c++. So test it with valgrind!

2. In my opinion it's more about explaining the concepts and showing that you understand it - so ask people why they wrote code like they did!

3. Check if the errors are handled properly and it will not come to leaks


And as always - be friendly!
