# 42_tests

This site is my personal testing site for 42 projects.

I'm still at the start of setting this up - so if you have any add ons - let me know.

general tests:
- nm -u program // to see the external used functions
- input: wrong argc, digits mixed with letters
- check function limits (usleep has limit uint max for example)
- Check with ulimits
- Check with valgrind
- Search for unprotected malloc / functions
-
