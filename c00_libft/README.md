# 42 LIBFT tests/evaluation

First project in the common core of the 42 curriculum. A lot of functions which can and will be used in later projects.

Some behaviour of the functions in my opinion is weird. So best test with a tester like francinette:
- [for home or github codespace](https://github.com/WaRtr0/francinette-image)
- [for campus](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette)

## To check with the evaluated student:
- the evaluated student should have a main for each requested libft function (best practise to have it inside the same file in a comment)
- malloc protection (search in the vscode search box for the malloc keyword), but as i mentioned in the beginning - some behaviour the functions should have for mulinette are weird. So if the francinette tester is OK, just make them aware of the malloc protection for future projects.
- check, how they explain their code (maybe one of each block)
- check for forbidden functions (like printf)
- show them functions like valgrind, [funcheck](https://github.com/tmatis/funcheck)

## Tip:
- let them know, that they can adapt libft after passing mulinette and add some additional malloc protections
