test with valgrind --tools=helgrind (for threads)
test with valgrind (for malloc errors)
(if necessary put an usleep in the checker function - mine only worked then)

Use visualizer like https://nafuka11.github.io/philosophers-visualizer/ (to see if the patterns seem right)

Use tester like

Allowed functions:
memset, printf, malloc, free, write,
usleep, gettimeofday, pthread_create,
pthread_detach, pthread_join, pthread_mutex_init,
pthread_mutex_destroy, pthread_mutex_lock,
pthread_mutex_unlock

NO exit function ALLOWED!

Check in the code if this functions are protected/the errors are handled:
- malloc
- usleep
- gettimeofday
- pthread_create (if this fails the loop with pthread_join/pthread_detach has to have a changed value - only wait for the created values)
- pthread_mutex_init
