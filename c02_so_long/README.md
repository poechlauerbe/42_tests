# 42 so long tests/evaluation

This is my dedicated testing site for the 42 so long project in C.

If you are evaluating somebody you can use this as an addon. __Make sure to also test what's inside the evaluation sheet!__

[Also see the general tests for all projects.](https://github.com/poechlauerbe/42_tests)

IN PROGRESS!!

- test with valgrind
```
valgrind ./so_long
```
