In my opinion net practice is not the best way to get into IT and networks...

For doing the exercises it is enough to know something about ip-addresses, subnettings and routing.

But I highly advice to have a look also into the following topics:
- OSI modell
- difference hub, switch, router, firewall, modem
- DHCP - fixed IPs
- DHCP reservation
- external / internal IPs
- Network-ports
- Portforwarding
- difference http / https


IN PROGRESS!!
